## üöÄ Instructions to Launch the Application

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.13 and pip installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdullah-masud/study-mate.git
cd study-mate
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. initialising the database

```bash
python main.py # or seed.py for initialising the database
```

### 5. Run the Flask App

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## üß™ Instructions for Running Tests

Follow these steps to properly set up and run the tests for StudyMate:

### 1. Database Setup

Since the submitted code does not include a pre-populated database, you need to initialize it:

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first
python seed.py
```

This script will:

- Create the necessary database tables
- Add a test user (Email: test@example.com, Password: Testpassword123ÔºÅ)
- Add sample study sessions to demonstrate app functionality

### 2. Running Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the core functionality of the application:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_unit.py -v
```

These tests check the API endpoints, database models, and basic application logic.

### 3. Running Selenium Tests

Selenium tests require the application to be running first:

#### Terminal 1: Start the Flask application

```bash
python main.py
```

#### Terminal 2: Run the Selenium tests

```bash
python -m tests.test_selenium
```

**Note:** Selenium tests require Chrome browser. The tests use webdriver-manager to automatically download the appropriate ChromeDriver version. If you encounter issues, ensure you have Chrome installed and that webdriver-manager is installed via:

```bash
pip install webdriver-manager
```

### 4. Troubleshooting

- **Database errors**: If you encounter database errors, try deleting the `instance/studymate_database.db` file and run `python seed.py` again.
- **Selenium test failures**: Ensure the Flask application is running on port 5000 before starting the tests.
- **Browser issues**: If the tests can't launch Chrome, try running in non-headless mode by editing `tests/test_selenium.py` and removing the `--headless` option.
